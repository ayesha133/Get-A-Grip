# Get-A-Grip
An academic project 

While working in pairs, we were assigned the task to design a computing program that would operate a robotic arm using two muscle sensor emulators. The computer program has the robotic arm succesfully identify all 6 surgical tools and transfer it to their appropriate autoclave bins for sterialization. All movements of the robotic arm are controlled by the two muscle sensor emulators. 

This program was all built in python using a rasberry pi and Quanser Interactive Labs.
